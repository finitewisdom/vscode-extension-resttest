# Identifize README

The **Identifize** extension for Visual Studio Code makes it easy to format identifiers by replacing non-alphanumeric characters
in the selection(s) with either hyphens or underscores, and forcing the entire string to either lowercase or uppercase.

This is useful for environments that have a convention for how identifiers are formatted. For example,
identifiers with uppercase letters and underscores (e.g. `NEW_STORE_COUNT`) are often used in C/C++. Identifiers with hyphens
(e.g. `new-store-table-id`) are often used in CSS, while lowercase identifiers with underscores (e.g. `new_store_count`) are often used in SQL.

The commands made available in the Command Palette by this extension are:
